# CoreCoord


## Intro 

```CoreCoord``` provides a very meaningful way to represent 2D values in 
games (and possible other applications too).   
We tried to keep the lib very simple only adding methods to ease the very 
common operations.


### Motivation:

Often in the Amazing Cow's board games we need a way to represent a 
two dimensional value - a coordinate - so instead of using types like C++ 
```std::pair<int,int>``` that doesn't provide enough context we decide to 
create a very, very simple type.

As usual, you are **very welcomed** to **share** and **hack** it.
