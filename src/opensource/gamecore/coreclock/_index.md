# CoreClock


## Intro 

```CoreClock``` is a small library intended to easy the time tracking in games,
but it general enough to be used in a myriad of situations.  
It can be used to _fire events_ after some time, giving a very flexible way 
to handle animations, callbacks and other stuff. 


### Motivation:

In some games we need to perform some operation repeatedly, or after some time.    
So instead of messing with _ivars_ to keep track of time and all other _"low-level"_
stuff we decide to create the ```CoreClock``` class to keep it very encapsulated.

As usual, you are **very welcomed** to **share** and **hack** it.
