# CoreMemory


## Intro 

This is a Game Core for Memory Game.   

### Motivation:

You can use it as a "lib" for making Memory Game in C++ concentrating 
your efforts in making a cool game interface and letting the logic of the 
game alone.

<br>

As usual, you are **very welcomed** to **share** and **hack** it.
